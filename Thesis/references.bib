    abstract = {Normalization helps us find a database schema at design time that can process the most frequent updates efficiently at run time. Unfortunately, relational normalization only works for idealized database instances in which duplicates and null markers are not present. On one hand, these features occur frequently in real-world data compliant with the industry standard SQL, and especially in modern application domains. On the other hand, the features impose challenges that make it difficult to extend the existing forty year old normalization framework to SQL, and any current extensions are fairly limited. We introduce a new class of functional dependencies and show that they provide the right notion for SQL schema design. Axiomatic and linear-time algorithmic characterizations of the associated implication problem are established. These foundations enable us to propose a Boyce–Codd normal form for SQL. We justify the normal form by showing that it permits precisely those SQL instances which are free from data redundancy. Unlike the relational case, there are SQL schemata that cannot be converted into Boyce–Codd normal form. Nevertheless, for an expressive sub-class of our functional dependencies we establish a normalization algorithm that always produces a schema in Value-Redundancy free normal form. This normal form permits precisely those instances which are free from any redundant data value occurrences other than the null marker. Experiments show that our functional dependencies occur frequently in real-world data and that they are effective in eliminating redundant values from these data sets without loss of information.}

               their role in bone health. Over the last ten years, the public
               has heard conflicting messages about other benefits of these
               nutrients---especially vitamin D---and also about how much
               calcium and vitamin D they need to be healthy. To help clarify
               this issue, the U. S. and Canadian governments asked the
               Institute of Medicine (IOM) to assess the current data on health
               outcomes associated with calcium and vitamin D. The IOM tasked a
               committee of experts with reviewing the evidence, as well as
               updating the nutrient reference values, known as Dietary
               Reference Intakes (DRIs). These values are used widely by
               government agencies, for example, in setting standards for
               school meals or specifying the nutrition label on foods. Over
               time, they have come to be used by health professionals to
               counsel individuals about dietary intake. The committee provided
               an exhaustive review of studies on potential health outcomes and
               found that the evidence supported a role for these nutrients in
               bone health but not in other health conditions. Further, there
               is emerging evidence that too much of these nutrients may be

               and lowering the concentrations of saturated ones. The present
               study aimed to examine the impact of the consumption of a dairy
               product (Pecorino cheese) rich in Conjugated Linoleic Acid (CLA)
               on lipid and health parameters in elderly subjects. During the

               phase, a double blind randomized crossover intervention study
               was conducted to verify the impact of enriched Pecorino cheese
               on LDL-Cholesterol (LDL-Ch) in elder individuals. 58 subjects
               were enrolled in a nursing home in Padua (Italy) a, with a mean
               age of 85.9$\pm$6.0 years, 42 subjects (72.4\%) were women.
               Study participants were randomly assigned to two groups: in one,
               they had a daily intake of up to 90g of Pecorino cheese rich in
               CLA (higher than 2.5\%), in the other, they were given the same
               quantity of a Pecorino control cheese (CLA lower than 1\%) for a
               two-month period. The active phase was followed by a one-month
               wash out period. The crossover was then carried out and
               participants ate the other type of cheese for two months. No
               significant differences were found in relation to LDL-Ch
               (estimated mean difference between group: 3.07 mg/dL, p=0.3171),
               while participants who consumed enriched cheese had a lower
               increase in glycaemia with respect to those assuming the control
               cheese (estimated mean difference between group: -0.07 g/L,
               p=0.0442). A significant carry-over effect was detected for
               HDL-Ch, tryglicerides, creatinine, sodium and vitamin D.
               Participants who consumed Pecorino cheese rich in CLA did not
               register an increase in lipid levels. More studies on humans are

              to vitamin D status at 6 months of age in predominantly breastfed
              infants; and to quantify the sunlight exposure required to
              achieve serum 25(OH)D level >20 ng/mL, by 6 months of age.
              DESIGN: Design: Prospective cohort. SETTING: Tertiary-care
              hospital predominantly catering to urban poor population in
              Delhi. PARTICIPANTS: 132 healthy infants, delivered at term, and
              predominantly breastfed were enrolled at 6-8 weeks of age. Of
              these, 100 infants were available for final evaluation at 6
              months of age (mean (SD) follow-up: 126 (17) days). METHODS:
              Baseline maternal vitamin D (serum 25(OH)D) levels were obtained
              at enrolment. The mothers were asked to maintain a daily record
              of duration of sunlight exposure, timing of exposure, and body
              surface area exposed, for the infant, on a pre-designed proforma,
              till the child was 6 months of age. Infant's serum 25(OH)D was
              measured at 6 months of age. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Cumulative
              Sun Index was calculated as a composite measure of overall
              duration/time/body surface area exposed to sunlight; and
              correlated with the infant serum 25(OH)D after adjusting for
              baseline maternal serum 25(OH)D levels, season of exposure, and
              skin color of the infant. Sun index for exposure in morning
              (before 10 am) and afternoon (10 am-3 pm) were also correlated to
              vitamin D status. RESULTS: Of 100 mother-infant pairs completing
              the study, 90 mothers had vitamin D deficiency (serum 25(OH)D 20
              ng/mL) by 6 months of age. CONCLUSION: There is a significant
              positive correlation between afternoon sunlight exposure and
              infant's vitamin D levels, independent of maternal vitamin D
              status. Randomized controlled trials are suggested to explore the
              effectiveness of this simple intervention to prevent or treat

  author   = "Niedermaier, Tobias and Gredner, Thomas and Kuznia, Sabine and
              Schottker, Ben and Mons, Ute and Lakerveld, Jeroen and
              Ahrens, Wolfgang and Brenner, Hermann and {PEN-Consortium}",
  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials have
              shown that vitamin D supplementation reduces cancer mortality by
              13\%. Vitamin D fortification of foods may increase vitamin D
              levels in a similar manner as vitamin D supplementation and could
              achieve similar reductions in cancer mortality. Whereas some
              European countries already implemented widespread fortification
              of foods with vitamin D, in other countries only few or no foods
              are fortified. In this study, we estimated the reduction in
              cancer mortality presumably already achieved by current
              fortification policies in 2017 and the potential for further
              reductions if all countries had effective fortification. METHODS:
              We reviewed scientific literature, publicly available
              information, and contacted health authorities to obtain
              information on current vitamin D food fortification policies in
              34 European countries. Together with country-specific cancer
              death statistics from Eurostat, information on life expectancy,
              and country-specific fortification policies, we used data from
              studies on supplementation and serum 25(OH)D increases and cancer
              mortality to estimate numbers of probably already prevented
              cancer deaths and numbers of potentially further preventable
              deaths and years of life lost. RESULTS: Current vitamin D
              fortification is estimated to prevent approximately 11,000 in the
              European Union and 27,000 cancer deaths in all European countries
              considered per year. If all countries considered here would
              implement adequate vitamin D fortification of foods, an estimated
              additional 129,000 cancer deaths (113,000 in the European Union)
              could be prevented, corresponding to almost 1.2 million prevented
              years of life lost (1.0 million in the EU) or approximately 9\%
              of cancer deaths (10\% in the EU). INTERPRETATION: Systematic
              fortification of foods might considerably reduce the burden of
              cancer deaths in Europe.",

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Since the 1997 Dietary Reference Intake (DRI) values
              for vitamin D and calcium were established new data have become
              available on their relationship, both individually and combined,
              to a wide range of health outcomes. The Institute of
              Medicine/Food and Nutrition Board has constituted a DRI committee
              to undertake a review of the evidence and potential revision of
              the current DRI values for these nutrients. To support this
              review, several US and Canadian federal government agencies
              commissioned a systematic review of the scientific literature for
              use during the deliberations by the committee. The intent of
              providing a systematic review to the committee is to support
              transparency of the literature review process and provide a
              foundation for subsequent reviews of the nutrients. PURPOSE: To
              systematically summarize the evidence on the relationship between
              vitamin D, calcium, and a combination of both nutrients on a wide
              range of health outcomes as identified by the IOM, AHRQ and
              technical expert panel convened to support the project. DATA
              SOURCES: MEDLINE; Cochrane Central; Cochrane Database of
              Systematic Reviews; and the Health Technology Assessments; search
              limited to English-language articles in humans. STUDY SELECTION:
              Primary interventional or observational studies that reported
              outcomes of interest in human subjects in relation to vitamin D
              and/or calcium, as well as systematic reviews that met the
              inclusion and exclusion criteria. Cross sectional and
              retrospective case-control studies were excluded. DATA
              EXTRACTION: A standardized protocol with predefined criteria was
              used to extract details on study design, interventions, outcomes,
              and study quality. DATA SYNTHESIS: We summarized 165 primary
              articles and 11 systematic reviews that incorporated over 200
              additional primary articles. Available evidence focused mainly on
              bone health, cardiovascular diseases or cancer outcomes. For many
              outcomes, it was difficult to draw firm conclusions on the basis
              of the available literature concerning the association of either
              serum 25(OH)D concentration or calcium intake, or the combination
              of both nutrients. Findings were inconsistent across studies for
              colorectal and prostate cancer, and pregnancy-related outcomes
              including preeclampsia. There were few studies for pancreatic
              cancer and immune function. Among trials of hypertensive adults,
              calcium supplementation lowered systolic, but not diastolic,
              blood pressure by 2-4 mm Hg. For body weight, the trials were
              consistent in finding no significant effect of increased calcium
              intake on weight. For growth rates, a meta-analysis did not find
              a significant effect on weight or height gain attributable to
              calcium supplement in children. For bone health, one systematic
              review found that vitamin D plus calcium supplementation resulted
              in small increases in BMD of the spine and other areas in
              postmenopausal women. For breast cancer, calcium intakes in
              premenopausal women were associated with a decreased risk. For
              prostate cancer, some studies reported that high calcium intakes
              were associated with an increased risk. LIMITATIONS: Studies on
              vitamin D and calcium were not specifically targeted at life
              stages (except for pregnant and postmenopausal women) specified
              for the determination of DRI. There is large variation on the
              methodological quality of studies examined. Use of existing
              systematic reviews limits analyses that could be performed on
              this source of information. CONCLUSIONS: The majority of the
              findings concerning vitamin D, calcium, or a combination of both
              nutrients on the different health outcomes were inconsistent.
              Synthesizing a dose-response relation between intake of either
              vitamin D, calcium, or both nutrients and health outcomes in this
              heterogeneous body of literature proved challenging.",

              management of obesity",
  author   = "James, W P and Avenell, A and Broom, J and Whitehead, J",
  abstract = "OBJECTIVES: This paper describes the methodology of a multicentre
              study designed to assess the efficacy and tolerability of
              orlistat 120 mg tid as therapy for inducing weight loss in excess
              of that achieved with a moderately calorie-restricted diet alone.
              The results from a single centre are presented to illustrate the
              nature of the response. DESIGN: This was a double-blind,
              randomized, parallel-group, placebo-controlled multicentre study.
              A four-week, single-blind, placebo run-in period preceded a 52
              week double-blind treatment period during which patients received
              either orlistat or placebo three times a day. At the start of the
              run-in period, all patients were placed on a diet containing
              approximately 30\% of calories as fat and designed to cause an
              energy deficit of approximately 600 kcal/d. SUBJECTS: Patients of
              either sex, more than 18 y of age, with a body mass index (BMI)
              between 30 and 43 kg/m2 were eligible for enrolment.
              MEASUREMENTS: Efficacy assessments included: measurements of body
              weight; anthropometry; quality of life; blood pressure; serum
              lipids; fasting serum glucose and insulin. Safety assessments
              included: adverse events; vital signs; ECG; renal and gallbladder
              ultrasound; haematology; serum biochemistry. OUTCOME: In the
              single centre there was a reduction in body weight of 5.5 +/- 4.5
              (s.d.) kg (5.7\% reduction) in the placebo group and 8.6 +/-
              5.4kg in the orlistat-treated group (8.4\% reduction) by six
              months. Thereafter, the placebo group tended to relapse whereas
              the orlistat group maintained their loss (2.6\% vs 8.4\%
              reduction from initial value at 52 weeks). Total and LDL
              cholesterol fell by 0.05 mmol/l (1.6\%) and 0.14 mmol/l (4.2\%),
              respectively, in orlistat treated patients. The drop-out rate was
              48\% in the placebo group and 39\% in the orlistat group.
              Intestinal symptoms related to orlistat were significantly
              increased compared to placebo but were well tolerated. Fat
              soluble vitamin levels remained within the normal range in the
              treatment group; the reduction seen in alpha-tocopherol levels in
              patients receiving orlistat was normalized by the decrease in
              plasma cholesterol concentrations. Beta-carotene and vitamin D
              concentrations also decreased in orlistat-treated patients.
              CONCLUSIONS: This preliminary analysis suggests that orlistat,
              when used with a health-promoting low-fat and moderately
              energy-restricted diet, confers advantages in the long-term
              management of obesity.",

abstract = {Television (TV) food advertising has attracted criticism for its potential role in promoting unhealthy dietary practices among children. Content analyses indicate junk food advertising is prevalent on Australian children's TV; healthy eating is rarely promoted. This paper presents (a) a cross-sectional survey examining associations between children's regular TV viewing habits and their food-related attitudes and behaviour; and (b) an experiment assessing the impact of varying combinations of TV advertisements (ads) for unhealthy and healthy foods on children's dietary knowledge, attitudes and intentions. The experimental conditions simulated possible models for regulating food ads on children's TV. Participants were 919 grade five and six students from schools in Melbourne, Australia. The survey showed that heavier TV use and more frequent commercial TV viewing were independently associated with more positive attitudes toward junk food; heavier TV use was also independently associated with higher reported junk food consumption. The experiment found that ads for nutritious foods promote selected positive attitudes and beliefs concerning these foods. Findings are discussed in light of methodological issues in media effects research and their implications for policy and practice. It is concluded that changing the food advertising environment on children's TV to one where nutritious foods are promoted and junk foods are relatively unrepresented would help to normalize and reinforce healthy eating.}

ABSTRACT = {Community coalitions can address local issues with deep, historic, and contextual understanding that enables customized implementation of evidence-based strategies. The individuals within the coalition, their partnerships, and the social context is likely an important component of unraveling the challenges of implementation so interventions reach people in need. We focus on the relevance of baseline coalition-committee network (CCN), the networks of purposely formed subcommittees within community coalitions, structure as one of the moderating, theoretical links between community coalition social networks and intervention success. We explore the baseline composition and characteristics of five CCNs at the beginning of childhood obesity prevention interventions. Using a combination of social network, multidimensional scaling, and correspondence analyses, we examine the structure and heterogeneity of five CCNs, each consisting of a core group of stakeholders in the coalition and sometimes the broader community itself. Cross-sectional analyses are used to examine the composition of coalition-committees related to network density, centralization, hierarchy, and coalition demographics and characteristics. Results indicate that CCNs are patterned in their structure and characteristics, and we discuss whether adjustments to childhood obesity prevention interventions according to baseline structure and characteristics could be advantageous for intervention implementation. Together, these findings can inform future longitudinal investigations into CCN network structure.},
